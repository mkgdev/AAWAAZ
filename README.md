#### Solution
Our application 'Awaaz' gives freedom of expression to the disabled ones (especially the paralyzed ones). The application expects minimum participation from the user in forms of blinks and converts it into texts using our application. The application employs Dlib and OpenCvâ€™s ML algorithms for detection .The software can be run on any low end computer, even on a Raspberry Pi to a high end computer.

### Application
It can be used to remove the communication gap between the abled and disabled ones. It provides a method for the disabled ones to express their ideas and thoughts to the world.
